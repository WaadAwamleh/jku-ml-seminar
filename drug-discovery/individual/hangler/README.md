# Notes

## Done:

- `Cl` as its own token or separate? → own token (Property of the Trie encoder)
- Extracted embedding from Coati → Embeddings with associated Smiles saved as .csv
- download Baseline Guacamol dataset

## In Process:
- preprocess guacamol dataset (add 3D coordinates and atoms to smile strings)
- train COATI on guacamol train set

## Next Steps

- compare results with Guacamol, MolGPT ([https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00600](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00600)) and MolReactGen
- Linear probing molecule net like done in CLAMP
- Embedding for classification task
