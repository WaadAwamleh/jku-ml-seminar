# Seminar and Master's Thesis Repository

This is the official repository for the seminar and master's thesis project, which encompasses two distinct groups: drug-discovery and EEG (Electroencephalography) research. This mono-repository is designed to facilitate coordination, version control, and collaboration between you all.

Most important thing:
your results should be reproducable and therefore well documented!!!

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the codebase and related resources for two parallel research streams:

1. **Drug Discovery**: 

2. **EEG (Electroencephalography) Research**: 

By maintaining a mono-repository, we aim to streamline collaboration and ensure consistent version control practices.

## Directory Structure

- `/drug-discovery`: Contains code, data, and resources for the drug-discovery group.
- `/eeg-research`: Contains code, data, and resources for the EEG research group.

Within the projects a suggestion would be:
- `*/individual/surname`: for your own stuff
- `*/external/`: for external repos
- `*/src/`: for shared source code
- `*/notebooks/`: for shared notebooks (or within your individual folder)
- `*/scripts/`: for scripts to run

-- 
please all try to mentain a README for both projects

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/phseidl/jku-ml-seminar23

2. Select a paper
Papers will be in a folder within the two groups in ````.*/data/papers/``, you can also propose your own paper for the seminar.
